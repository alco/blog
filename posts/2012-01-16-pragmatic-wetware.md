Andy Hunt on Our Wetware
========================

If you consider yourself a programmer, you absolutely have to listen to this
brilliant [interview][1] with Andy Hunt, one of the co-authors of the
[Pragmatic Programmer][2] book.

Don't rush. Find a silent place where no one will disturb you for half an hour.
It's better to get away from the computer or at least to turn off your
monitor(s). I find it most comfortable to put on headphones, lay on a sofa, and
enjoy this inspiring and thought-provoking interview with my eyes closed.

Once you have listened to it once, do it again one or two days later. This
time, do it while sitting at your desk and taking notes. In the future, refer
to the notes when you get mixed up in the every-day life and forget about the
one thing that really matters: this is your life and you've got only one chance
at living it. Embrace stuff that makes you a better programmer and a better
person in general. Filter out stuff that is slowing you down or distracting
you.
