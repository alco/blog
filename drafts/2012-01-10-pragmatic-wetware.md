Andy Hunt on Our Wetware
========================

If you call yourself a programmer, you absolutely have to listen to this
brilliant [interview][1] with Andy Hunt, one of the co-authors of the
[Pragmatic Programmer][2] book.

Don't rush. Find a silent place where no one will disturb you for half an hour.
It's better to get away from the computer or at least to turn off the
monitor(s). I find it most comfortable to put on headphones, lay on my back on
a sofa, and enjoy this inspiring and thought-provoking interview with my eyes
closed.

Once you have listened to it once, do it again the next day. This time, do it
while sitting at your desk and taking notes. In the future, refer to the notes
every time you get mixed up in the every-day life and forget about the one
important thing: this is your life and you've got only one chance at living it.
Don't waste your time doing what others tell you to do. People that are crazy
enough to think they can change the world are usually the ones who do.
