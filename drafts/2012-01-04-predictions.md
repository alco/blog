My Predictions for 2012
=======================

I find it amusing to read other people's predictions made one year, two years,
or even a decade ago. Such things give a kind of insight on the thinking that was
popular at that time in the past. 

I decided to give it a try myself. Here's my list of things that are going to
happen by the end of this year.

* Functional programming will experience a huge increase in adoption. If not
  Haskell, then Clojure will definitely become one of the mainstream languages
  like C, Java, Python, or Ruby.

* Coffescript's user base will become a rival to that of Javascript. 

* Ludum Dare 23 will record more than 1000 participants. They'll have to
  improve the rating system though. It's kind of unreal to expect each
  participant to rate each other's game. 

* iPhone 5 will feature a new lockscreen with face recognition
