My Predictions for 2012
=======================

I find it amusing to read other people's predictions made some time in the
past: one year, two years, or even a decade ago. I decided to give it a try
myself. Here's my list of things as we will have witnessed them when 2013
arrives.

* Functional programming will experience a huge increase in adoption. If not
  Haskell, then Clojure will be on its way to become one of the mainstream
  languages like C, Java, Python, or Ruby.

* CoffeScript's user base will surpass that of JavaScript.

* We will reach a general consensus that in order to manage concurrency we have
  to step away from locks and adopt more intuitive techniques which are easier
  to reason about. GCD, transactions, immutability are only a few that come to
  mind.

* One of Ludum Dare events will record more than 1000 participants. They'll
  have to improve the rating system though. It's kind of impossible for each
  participant to rate every other game.

* Although freemium games will certainly dominate the _Top Grossing_ list of
  App Store and similar marketplaces, most sensible people will come to respect
  indie games even more. And Humble Indie Bundle will continue to spread the
  indie love to masses.

* iPhone 5 will feature a new lock screen with face recognition.

* Schools all over the world will adopt new teaching techniques. Khan Academy
  may itself become a widely adopted teaching resource like Wikipedia has
  become _the_ encyclopedia of the world.

* The people of Belarus will take radical actions in order to liberate
  themselves from the dictatorship of Lukashenko and turn their country into a
  democratic state.

All in all, let's hope the world will be a better place one year from now.
